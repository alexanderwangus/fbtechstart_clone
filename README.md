<h2> Link for Communication </h2>
We have chosen to use a <a href="https://fbtechstart.slack.com/" target="_blank">Slack Channel</a> to communicate with each other. <br>
To get in touch with our group, please email <a href="fbtechstart@googlegroups.com" target="_blank">fbtechstart@googlegroups.com</a>.

<h2> Benchmarking Activity </h2>
In preparation of our needfinding we researched various aspects of the issue of low income and diverse student participation in Computer Science. Here are some of the articles we read through: <br/>
[On Google's Diversity efforts](http://fortune.com/google-diversity/)<br/>
[Management Leadership for Tomorrow examines the confidence minority students have that they can be successful when considering jobs in various industries](http:://ml4t.org/insights/mlt-perspectives-white-paper/)<br/>
[YesWeCode Resources](http://www.yeswecode.org/the_future_of_tech_diversity_and_inclusion_apply_to_the_yeswecode_coding_corps)<br/>
[An involved contact shared this resource with us, saying that we "needed to be in Oakland"](https://medium.com/@cklshorall/2800-oakland-unified-students-enrolled-in-computer-science-in-2016-17-87277f99480b?source=linkShare-d030d4c339eb-1485839323)<br/>

<h2> Needfinding Activity </h2>
Before any interviews, we compiled a [needfinding brainstorm sheet](https://docs.google.com/document/d/1mj2fpM7I16-1uJ0Er_FN78Y5MPBIf1A6aOEU844sZ30/edit?usp=sharing)

We visited Sequoia High in order to talk to students of the Techstart program, and to Charles Dodge, the teacher in charge. We also did a video chat interview with Derrick McMillen, a CS teacher at Coliseum College Prep HS in Oakland, which also has a Techstart program.

<h2> Brainstorming </h2>
After collecting and debriefing our notes from our needfinding, we performed a brainstorming session. We made observations from our interviews, collected them into categories, drew links between categories, then derived needs from these clusters.
