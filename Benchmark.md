In preparation for our needfinding, we carefully researched the topic of making Computer Science accessible to low-income students and students from underrepresented backgrounds. Here are some of the articles we read and discussed: <br/>

###[On Google's Diversity efforts](http://fortune.com/google-diversity/)
*Why now? There is perhaps a dollop of public relations in the effort and certainly an element of doing the right thing. (Might the company’s oft-mocked motto of “Don’t be evil” apply?) Silicon Valley in general has been harshly criticized in recent years for being overwhelmingly male and largely devoid of non-Asian people of color. But there is another potent factor in play too: A growing realization inside the company’s Mountain View, Calif., headquarters that not embracing diversity might impede Google’s ability to keep growing. How can it learn to better serve the billions of people on the planet for whom its search has not thus far been optimized?*

###[Minority Student Confidence in Tech Sector](http:://ml4t.org/insights/mlt-perspectives-white-paper/)<br/>
*Increased exposure to diverse individuals who have been successful is a critical lever for raising student confidence. We asked students a number of questions about their relationships and examined how their answers impacted their confidence. Students who report knowing a diverse individual who has been successful in a sector are much more likely to be confident they can succeed in that sector.*

###[YesWeCode Resources](http://www.yeswecode.org/the_future_of_tech_diversity_and_inclusion_apply_to_the_yeswecode_coding_corps)
*YesWeCode accelerates access to training in high-demand technical and non-technical skills to prepare untapped talent to enter the tech-fueled economy. #YesWeCode is building a diverse pipeline of 'homegrown' tech talent to meet demand and boost local economies.*

###[More than 2800 Oakland Unified students enrolled in Computer Science](https://medium.com/@cklshorall/2800-oakland-unified-students-enrolled-in-computer-science-in-2016-17-87277f99480b?source=linkShare-d030d4c339eb-1485839323)
Derrick McMillen, a Techstart teacher at Oakland Unified School District, shared this article with us, emphasizing that we should learn about the work that Oakland is doing to make Computer Science education more accessible: *Oakland’s public schools are aware of lacking diversity in tech and are taking action. Instead of simply broadening the pipeline, the Oakland Unified School District has dug an entirely new trench, thus laying the groundwork to teach all students computer science — an agency-creating course necessary for access, sustainability, and choice in the 21st century. This growth is due to collaboration with industry (Intel, Salesforce, SAP), nonprofit, and government entities, and a district-wide partnership with Code.org.*

###[Sequoia High Gets Wired](https://www.google.com/amp/www.cio.com/article/2442414/it-organization/sequoia-high-gets-wired.amp.html)
An article on the efforts in a Redwood City high school we plan to visit: *Sequoia High, like many Redwood City schools, has in fact verged on the moribund in recent years. Decades of low test scores resulted in the widespread flight of well-heeled white students to private schools. Today, the majority of students are of Latino heritage. Many live below the poverty line. Home PCs and Internet access have not been a fixture in most Sequoia students’ lives, but technology is a fixture of the community itself. With its stellar weather and convenient location between San Francisco and San Jose, Redwood City has become something of a high-tech mecca in the past year or so. Companies such as broadband services provider Excite@Home, IP telephony vendor Clarent Corp. and market researcher Zona Research make their headquarters in shiny chrome-and-glass buildings here. Cisco Systems, Oracle and Sun Microsystems are just down the street from Sequoia in neighboring towns. Though they are surrounded by need—hundreds of economically disadvantaged schoolchildren—these vendors have not always seen themselves as potential white knights. But that is slowly changing as some vendors have begun investing in the local schools—donating equipment, participating in job-shadowing programs, creating internships—doing their part to make President Clinton’s dream of ubiquitous Internet access for every schoolchild in America a reality. Redwood City in particular has been seeking ways to close the digital divide as local educators have begun building a comprehensive, multitiered IT curriculum for all school levels.*

###[Should CS Ed be in bed with the College Board?](http://cestlaz.github.io/posts/cs-ed-in-bed-college-board/#.WJgWmLYrKlO)
*I've been working towards getting CS to all students for most of my career and while it's wonderful to see us getting closer to the goal, I'm seeing more and more signs that my caution is becoming reality. and CS Ed is going the way of other Ed - aligned to testing and more to the whims of the power players and politicians than to teachers and students.*
