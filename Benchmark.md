In preparation for our needfinding, we carefully researched the topic of making Computer Science accessible to low-income students and students from underrepresented backgrounds. Here are some of the articles we read and discussed: <br/>

###[On Google's Diversity efforts](http://fortune.com/google-diversity/)
*Why now? There is perhaps a dollop of public relations in the effort and certainly an element of doing the right thing. (Might the company’s oft-mocked motto of “Don’t be evil” apply?) Silicon Valley in general has been harshly criticized in recent years for being overwhelmingly male and largely devoid of non-Asian people of color. But there is another potent factor in play too: A growing realization inside the company’s Mountain View, Calif., headquarters that not embracing diversity might impede Google’s ability to keep growing. How can it learn to better serve the billions of people on the planet for whom its search has not thus far been optimized?*

*Increased exposure to diverse individuals who have been successful is a critical lever for raising student confidence. We asked students a number of questions about their relationships and examined how their answers impacted their confidence. Students who report knowing a diverse individual who has been successful in a sector are much more likely to be confident they can succeed in that sector.*
