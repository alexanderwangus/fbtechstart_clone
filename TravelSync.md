Spark has chosen to attend [The Asian Conference on Education & International Development 2017](http://iafor.org/conferences/aceid2017/). The conference aims to not only bring together educators, but also address the issue of creating lasting impact in one's life through education. We believe this message resonates deeply with our project mission, to leverage computer science to spark the imagination, instill self-belief and unlock future opportunities for students. We also hope to visit several classrooms while in Japan, to explore and understand the role of computer science in classrooms there.
