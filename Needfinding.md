<h2>Needfinding Activity</h2>
<h3>Preparation</h3>
Before any interviews, we compiled a [needfinding brainstorm document](https://docs.google.com/document/d/1mj2fpM7I16-1uJ0Er_FN78Y5MPBIf1A6aOEU844sZ30/edit?usp=sharing), where we outlined questions that we would ask students and teachers at high schools that are part of the Techstart program. The document also included some general ideas that we wanted to explore, as well as a list of additional contacts in the Computer Science education space that we could reach out to. 
<h3>Interviews</h3>
We visited Sequoia High in order to talk to Techstart students and Cameron Dodge, the teacher in charge of Sequoia's Techstart program. We also did a video chat interview with Derrick McMillen, a CS teacher at Coliseum College Prep High School in Oakland, which also has a Techstart program.
