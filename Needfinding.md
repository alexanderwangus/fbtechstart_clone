<h2>Needfinding Activity</h2>
Before any interviews, we compiled a [needfinding brainstorm sheet](https://docs.google.com/document/d/1mj2fpM7I16-1uJ0Er_FN78Y5MPBIf1A6aOEU844sZ30/edit?usp=sharing)

We visited Sequoia High in order to talk to students of the Techstart program, and to Cameron Dodge, the teacher in charge. We also did a video chat interview with Derrick McMillen, a CS teacher at Coliseum College Prep HS in Oakland, which also has a Techstart program.
