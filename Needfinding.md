<h2>Needfinding </h2>
<h3>Preparation</h3>
Before any interviews, we compiled a [detailed needfinding brainstorm document](https://docs.google.com/document/d/1mj2fpM7I16-1uJ0Er_FN78Y5MPBIf1A6aOEU844sZ30/edit?usp=sharing), where we outlined questions that we would ask students and teachers at high schools that are part of the Techstart program. The document also included some general ideas that we wanted to explore, as well as a list of additional contacts in the Computer Science education space that we could reach out to. 

**Some questions we had for teachers:**
* Do you need to be enrolled in a CS class to be in Techstart, or if the school has a CS class and is a Techstart participant, anyone can be in Techstart?
* What is the biggest barrier to using the Oculus equipment?
* What is the biggest challenge about working with students in the Techstart program?
* How many students start doing Techstart and stay in the program vs. drop out?
* Is there any incentive structure?
* How deep is the interest in Techstart? (do you have enough resources for everyone whoâ€™s interested?)
* How often does Techstart meet?
* Roughly how many students per class?
* How did you create (or what was your thought process while creating) your curriculum?
* How successful has your curriculum been?
* Tell us about a day in TechStart.
* What is your day-to-day like?
* What percentage of students in the Techstart program are low-income?
* How do you assess success for this program?
* What are the class sizes at school?

**Some questions we had for students:**
* What are your plans for after high school?
* Do you want to go to college?
* How much free time do you have?
* How do you spend your free time?
* What do you wish you had more time for?
* What extracurriculars do you participate in?
* What other classes are you in?
* What are your favorite other classes?
* Are you planning to continue with CS? (Java Class)
* What is your perception of CS?
* Is CS a supported part of the status quo or stigmatized (is it cool or lame)?
* Does CS seem accessible? Why?
* What CS initiatives already exist or have existed in your school? Were they successful? 
* Personally, how do you like the CS initiatives at your school, if any?


<h3>Interviews</h3>
We visited Sequoia High in order to talk to Techstart students and Cameron Dodge, the teacher in charge of Sequoia's Techstart program. At Sequoia, we interviewed 12 different students in total, taking detailed notes about each interview. We also did a video chat interview with Derrick McMillen, a CS teacher at Coliseum College Prep High School in Oakland, which also has a Techstart program.

<h3>Clustering Observations to Identify Needs</h3>
We clustered what we observed, heard, and noted during our interviews into groups in order to help us define needs for the Techstart program. You can view the needs we identified [here](https://docs.google.com/document/d/1z1G-00bip9J17MmZzUHcNbuk2TNSwjPa1JTgBmCbjXE/edit).
