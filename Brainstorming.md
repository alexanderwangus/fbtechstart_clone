<h2> Brainstorming </h2>
After collecting and debriefing our notes from our needfinding and identifying a series of [needs](https://docs.google.com/document/d/1z1G-00bip9J17MmZzUHcNbuk2TNSwjPa1JTgBmCbjXE/edit), which we revised into How Might We statements, we performed a brainstorming session to come up with solutions to those How Might We statements. We grouped the solutions into clusters based around specific themes.
